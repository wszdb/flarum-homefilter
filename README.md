```

### Method 2: Manual Installation



1. Download this repository to the `extensions` directory of Flarum:



```
cd /path/to/flarum/extensions

git clone https://github.com/wszdb/flarum-homefilter.git wszdb-homefilter
```



1. Install dependencies and compile frontend assets:



```
cd wszdb-homefilter

composer install --no-dev

```



1. Enable the extension in the Flarum backend

## ⚙️ Configuration Instructions

### Backend Settings

Navigate to **Admin Dashboard → Extensions → Home Filter** to configure:



1. **Filter Keywords**

* Enter keywords to be restricted, with multiple keywords separated by English commas

* Example: `Advertisement,Promotion,Marketing,Spam`

* Matching Rule: A post is identified if its title contains any of the keywords

1. **Keyword Post Quantity Limit**

* Set the maximum number of posts containing keywords to be displayed on the home page

* Default Value: 5

* Value Range: 1-50

### Working Principle



```
Original Home Page (20 posts)

├─ Posts containing keywords: 10

└─ Posts without keywords: 10

↓ After Applying Filter (Limit: 5)

Filtered Home Page (20 posts)

├─ Posts containing keywords: 5 ✓

└─ Posts without keywords: 15 ✓ (Automatically supplemented)
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Mechanisms



1. **SQL Query Layer Filtering**

* Pre-filters during the database query phase

* Uses subqueries to count the number of keyword-containing posts

* Automatically expands the query scope to compensate for filtered posts

1. **Data Processing Layer Precision Control**

* Performs secondary processing on query results

* Ensures the number of keyword-containing posts strictly meets the limit

* Guarantees the total number of returned posts matches the original request

### Compatibility



* ✅ Flarum 1.8.x

* ✅ Flarum 2.0+ (Theoretically compatible, testing required)

* ✅ PHP 8.0+

* ✅ MySQL 5.7+ / MariaDB 10.2+

### Performance Optimization



* Only enabled on the home page (no search/tag filtering applied)

* Uses database indexes to speed up keyword matching

* Avoids full-table scans for high query efficiency
