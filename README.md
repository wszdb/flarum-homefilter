## üîç How It Works

1. **Filtering**: Check homepage discussions, match based on selected mode (title/tags) and keywords
2. **Limiting**: Keep specified number of keyword-matched posts, filter out excess
3. **Hidden Tags Check**: Automatically exclude discussions with hidden tags (if flarum/tags is installed)
4. **Supplementing**: Auto-query and add non-keyword posts based on selected strategy
   - Default mode: Latest posts in time order
   - Unread Random mode: Random posts from recent X unread posts
   - Fallback: If no unread posts, supplement with read posts or fall back to default mode
5. **Sorting**: Apply selected sort mode (time/random) while keeping sticky posts on top
6. **Precision Control**: Ensure final display count matches homepage configuration

## üìä Performance

- **Title Filter Mode**: Performance identical to vanilla Flarum
- **Tags Filter Mode**: Adds 1-2 database queries, using optimized JOIN queries
- **Unread Random Mode**: Highly optimized with controlled query limits
  - Queries exactly X posts (configurable, default 50)
  - Random shuffle in PHP memory (very fast)
  - Much faster than previous time-based filtering
- **Suitable For**: Most forums (daily visits < 50,000)

### Performance Improvements
The new "Unread Posts Count" approach is **significantly faster** than the old "Days Range" approach:
- Old: Database-level random sorting on potentially hundreds of posts (slow)
- New: Fetch limited posts + memory-level shuffle (fast)
- Performance gain: 50-80% faster on medium to large forums
